# Hello world, I'm Carlos! 

## 📌 About me

Since 2020 when I was a simple knowledge's lover, I found a way to create a lot of things with my own hands, my fingers, brain and creativity. I tried to build projects of Frontend, after that: Backend. In this moment of my life I continue learning every day to be a great developer. 
In addition to, currently I am a Frontend Developer in a International Corporative.
